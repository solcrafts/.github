# Solcraft

**Solcraft** is an AI-native builder organization focused on **Solana**, **Agent-Onchain workflows**, and the next evolution of **Pump.fun meme ecosystems**.

We build products that turn ideas into execution:
- AI generates project directions and product plans.
- Agents coordinate coding, onchain actions, and launch flows.
- Humans keep final authority through explicit wallet confirmations.

## What We Build

### 1. SOLABS
The core product studio (currently in `./solcraft`).

SOLABS is designed to help founders and builders:
- Generate new Solana project ideas with AI agents.
- Turn concepts into implementation-ready vibe coding prompts.
- Launch project tokens to Pump.fun in a one-stop flow.
- Extend agent capability through `skill.fun`.
- Use **PUMPCLAW** for agent-driven token launch execution.

### 2. AGIPOCKET
An agent-native Solana extension wallet.

AGIPOCKET enables:
- Agent-driven protocol access based on `skill.md` workflows.
- Autonomous request composition and transaction preparation.
- Human-in-the-loop confirmation for every signature and tx approval.
- Strategy-based meme token discovery and trading execution in Pump lists.

### 3. PUMPCLAW
An agent launch service for Pump.fun.

PUMPCLAW allows any agent to:
- Describe token metadata in a `moltx` post.
- Convert that intent into a structured launch request.
- Execute automated Pump.fun token deployment as onchain action.

## Why Solcraft

We believe the next Solana cycle is driven by three shifts:

1. **AI in product definition**  
AI should decide not only how to build, but also what is worth building.

2. **Agents in execution**  
Agents should run persistent workflows across tools, data, and onchain protocols.

3. **Agent-Onchain value loops**  
Narrative -> planning -> transaction -> liquidity feedback should become a programmable loop.

## Ecosystem Direction

Solcraft is building infrastructure where:
- Founders can go from narrative to launch faster.
- Agents can operate with bounded autonomy.
- Human signatures remain the final trust boundary.
- Meme economies become more structured, testable, and composable.
